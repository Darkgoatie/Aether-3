# Project Aether

Aether, the discord bot project. This is the third version of Aether, which uses more efficient ways than the other versions.

## Important Note

Please do not clone the bot Aether using the source code. The source code is only shared for educational purposes and for helping new developers. I please you to not use the code for bad purposes.

## Features

Aether used to had way more features in Aether V2 (Discord.js v12). Since I just started updating to Discord.js v13, not all of the commands are avaliable right now. But no worries! I've got some plans on making the commands on Aether V3.

### These are the current planned features right now:

- [x] Auctions
- [x] Giveaways
- [x] Vouches
- [ ] Lotteries
- [ ] Moderation Commands

The checked in box in the list means that it's done! I'll be updating you guys in the [support server](https://discord.com/invite/Dn3VJmP3Ba)!
